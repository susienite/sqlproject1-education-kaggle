The purpose of this project is to provide a simple, practical demonstration of using SQL to analyze the "Student Performance on Exams" dataset from Kaggle.

Through creating a relational database, importing real-world data, and writing structured SQL queries, this project explores how student academic outcomes (math, reading, and writing scores) vary based on parental education level and other demographic factors.

The project highlights key SQL skills such as data import, aggregation, grouping, ordering, and basic exploratory data analysis.
